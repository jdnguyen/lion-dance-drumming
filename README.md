lion-dance-drumming
===================

A very basic mobile app using AndEngine to do some basic lion dance drumming

I wanted to try the game engine, AndEngine, and made this about two years ago. I decided to uploaded it.
It was meant to be a DDR like game but it never finished. So you can just drum away to practice.

It will need AndEngine to run.

You can get it from Google Play here: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Dragonfly.LDDrumming
